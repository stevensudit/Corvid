1. Do all the TODO's scattered throughout the code.
a. Interval needs a major rewrite.
c. concat_join has lots to do. and conversion.h has a related change.
e. string.h has some TODO's.
f. bitmask_enum_tests has some.
g. meta_test has a whole section commented out.
h. strings_test needs more tests.

2. Consider how ostream could be made optional.

3. We need a verson of split that understands quotes and escaping. Maybe just regex and be done with it?

4. Test enums with int64.

5. Not sure if it's possible, or desirable, but can we overload operators for bitmask and sequence enums to allow comparison with the underlying type? It's still type-safe, but now we don't need to "deref".

  // TODO: Fix splitter, working on adding a filter predicate and perhaps
  // allowing assignment to arbitrary containers.

6. Remove CRTP using "deducing this".

7. Consider adding `final` to classes that really ought to be.

8. meta/containers.h search_and_replace: Consider adding a version that takes parallel arrays for `from` and `to`, replacing all of them. This can't be emulated by nesting.

9. strings/fixed_string_utils.h: Consider writing a version of split that also does a search/replace in parallel (one pass to locate, count, and do the replacements).

10. strings/locating.h substitution/excision improvements:
   a. Substituted and excised don't work for initializer lists. Wrap them.
   b. Excise can always be optimized to do a single pass over the string (locate and copy, skipping the excised parts).
   c. Consider replacing free functions with something more object-oriented (fluent interface or builder pattern).
   d. Benchmark whether it's faster to do replacements in-place or to build a new string with pre-allocated capacity.
   e. If span size is 1, forward to regular locate with pos_value hardcoded to zero, since we know which value it was.

11. strings/conversion.h: Add thorough testing for from_chars_wrap, or replace with a stable third-party library.

12. strings/trimming.h: Determine if there's a safe, correct way to pass through a temporary container without lifetime issues.

13. strings/splitting.h enhancements:
   a. Probably kill the hardcoded vector-only split() overloads that return std::vector.
   b. Consider supporting extended concept where there's a way to register custom splitter behavior.
   c. Write helper in locating.h to take a `location` and return a substring span.
   d. Write split_adapter version that works with any container that can emplace_back.
   e. Implement split_adapter with efficient pre-allocation and single-pass splitting.
   f. Benchmark and optimize single-char delimiter handling.

14. strings/concat_join.h improvements:
   a. Consider adding !Container validation and null key handling in append_join_with for pairs.
   b. Test quote-encoding when a non-string is wrapped in quotes.
   c. Add method that takes pieces and counts up their total (estimated) size for pre-allocation.
   d. Benchmark delim `find` single-char optimizations to verify performance gains.
   e. Consider offering a way to register a tuple-view function for use in formatted output.
   f. Consider offering the reverse of `stream_append_v` for deserialization.
