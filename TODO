0. Do all the TODO's scattered throughout the code.

1. Make decision about op<< for enum.

2. Look at absl split and how it sniffs out return type automatically. Also, adding a filter.

3. Consider how ostream could be made optional.

4. Maybe a quoted_string child of string_view that tells the appender to encode it. Maybe add a JSON mode, outright.

5. We need a verson of split that understands quotes and escaping. Maybe just regex and be done with it?
