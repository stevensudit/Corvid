1. Do all the TODO's scattered throughout the code.
a. Interval needs a major rewrite.
c. concat_join has lots to do. and conversion.h has a related change.
e. string.h has some TODO's.
f. bitmask_enum_tests has some.
g. meta_test has a whole section commented out.
h. strings_test needs more tests.

3. Consider how ostream could be made optional.

5. We need a verson of split that understands quotes and escaping. Maybe just regex and be done with it?

6. Test enums with int64.

7. Add noexcept wherever it fits.

8. Reverse all locate methods.

9. Not sure if it's possible, or desirable, but can we overload operators for bitmask and sequence enums to allow comparison with the underlying type? It's still type-safe, but now we don't need to "deref".

Next target: JSON encoding of strings.

  // TODO: Fix splitter, working on adding a filter predicate and perhaps
  // allowing assignment to arbitrary containers.
