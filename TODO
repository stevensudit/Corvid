1. Do all the TODO's scattered throughout the code.
a. Interval needs a major rewrite.
c. concat_join has lots to do. and conversion.h has a related change.
d. trimming has a long shot.
e. string.h has some TODO's.
f. bitmask_enum_tests has some.
g. meta_test has a whole section commented out.
h. strings_test needs more tests.


2. Look at absl split and how it sniffs out return type automatically. Also, adding a filter.

3. Consider how ostream could be made optional.

4. Maybe a quoted_string child of string_view that tells the appender to encode it. Maybe add a JSON mode, outright.

5. We need a verson of split that understands quotes and escaping. Maybe just regex and be done with it?

6. Test enums with int64.

Next target: JSON encoding of strings.

Try turning make enum spec functions consteval.
