// PID controller class.
//
// The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is a common control
// loop feedback mechanism used in industrial control systems.
//
// The object is stateful and initialized with the three gain parameters. This
// implementation also takes an alpha parameter to control the derivative term,
// as well as min and max values to clamp the output.
//
// The initialized instance is then called periodically with the current
// setpoint and measured value, as well as the timestamp, returning the new
// input to the system. With proper tuning, the measured value will converge to
// the setpoint.
//
// The difference between the setpoint and measured value is the error. The
// controller seeks to minimize it over time by providing the next input into
// the control system. It calculates this by summing the three terms:
// Proportional, Integral, and Derivative.
//
// The P (Proportional) term is calculated by multiplying the current error by
// Kp, the proportional gain. It isn't stateful, since only the current error
// is used.
//
// This term is immediate and reactive. Intuitively, the further we are
// from the setpoint, the more we want to correct things.
//
// If the Kp is too low, the controller may not ever reach the setpoint,
// resulting in a steady-state undershoot error. If it is too high, the
// controller may oscillate around the setpoint, never settling down. Even when
// not overtuned, it might overshoot the setpoint or end up with a steady-state
// error in either direction.
//
// The I (Integral) term is calculated by multiplying the cumulative
// error by Ki, the integral gain. This is stateful: it depends on the
// total error over time.
//
// This term is cumulative and slow. Intuitively, the longer we are
// away from the setpoint, the more we want to correct it. This ensures
// that we eventually reach the setpoint, but it can also lead to
// overshoot and oscillation if not tuned properly.
//
// If the Ki is too low, the controller may never reach the setpoint, leading
// to a steady-state error. If it is too high, the controller may overshoot
// the setpoint or oscillate around it. Even when not overtuned, it might
// overshoot the setpoint before settling down.
//
// The cumulative error is itself calculated by keeping a total of the
// error over time. Each time we accumulate the error, we first scale
// it by the time interval since the last measurement.
//
// However, this leads to the risk of integral windup, where the integral term
// grows too large during periods when the system is not responding, such as
// during a disturbance or a large setpoint change. To mitigate this, we can
// implement anti-windup strategies, such as clamping the integral term (which
// is what we did here) or resetting it when the error is small.
//
// The D (Derivative) term is calculated by multiplying the rate of
// change of the error by Kd, the derivative gain. This is stateful: it
// depends on the change in error over time.
//
// This term is anticipatory and dampening. Intuitively, the faster we
// approach the setpoint, the less we want to correct it. This helps
// prevent overshoot and oscillation by reducing the response.
//
// If the Kd is too low, the controller may overshoot the setpoint or
// oscillate around it. If it is too high, the controller may become
// too slow to respond to changes in the setpoint or disturbances, leading
// to sluggishness.
//
// The rate of change of the error is calculated by taking the difference
// between the current error and the previous error, divided by the time
// interval since the last measurement. However, this can lead to noise
// amplification, especially if the time interval is small or the system is
// noisy. To mitigate this, we can implement filtering strategies, such as
// low-pass filtering the error signal (which is what we did here) or using a
// moving average.
//
// The D-term often spikes on the first update or during transients, which can
// be problematic. Possible mitigations include: applying a low-pass filter to
// the derivative term (we do this), introducing a deadband around the setpoint
// to suppress noise near zero error, zeroing out the derivative on the first
// update (we also do this), and computing the derivative based on the rate of
// change in the measured value instead of the error.
