# Claude Code Rules for Corvid Project

## Build System
- Always use CMake to build files, never direct calls to clang or g++ (unless you are specifically debugging issues related to build flags, such as release/debug or optimization level)
- **IMPORTANT**: CMake build commands MUST be run from the tests/ directory, NOT from the project root
  - The build directory is at `tests/build/`, not at the root level
  - Always use: `cd tests && cmake --build build --target <target>`
  - If you're not sure what directory you're in, check with `pwd` first
- When creating new test files, they will be automatically picked up by CMakeLists.txt (it globs *.cpp files)
- **cleanbuild.sh**: Run `./cleanbuild.sh` from project root for a clean build and execution of all unit tests
  - Use this to check for regressions globally after broad changes
  - Run before commits are ready to be pushed into a PR
  - Optional arguments: `libstdcpp` or `libcxx` to choose standard library, `tidy` to run clang-tidy

## Code Style
- Avoid using emojis in code or comments unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- When referencing code locations, always use markdown link format: `[filename.ext:line](filename.ext#Lline)` to make them clickable in the IDE
- **format_all.sh**: Run `./format_all.sh` from project root to format all source files with clang-format
  - Run before committing changes to ensure consistent formatting (It is understood that the ideal solution is a git hook, but this is out of scope for now)

## Git Operations
- When the user asks to commit changes, use `git add .` to stage all changes (including user-made modifications)
- This ensures any additional changes the user made are included in the commit
- Use `git switch` instead of `git checkout` for switching branches (safer and clearer intent)

## Testing
- Test executables are built to: tests/build/release_bin/
- The test framework is minitest (custom, minimal test framework)
- Tests use EXPECT_EQ, EXPECT_TRUE, etc. macros
- Test files follow the pattern: *_test.cpp

## Project Structure
- Headers: corvid/**/*.h
- Tests: tests/*_test.cpp
- String utilities: corvid/strings/
- Test framework: tests/minitest.h
- **TODO file**: The project uses a TODO file at the root level to track enhancement requests and design decisions
  - When encountering TODO comments in code that represent enhancement requests (not immediate implementation tasks), move them to the TODO file
  - Keep TODO comments in code only for items that should be addressed soon as part of ongoing work

## Specific Notes
- The project uses C++23 standard
- Prefer libc++ (Clang's standard library) over libstdc++
- Base string types position and npos are defined in corvid/strings/string_base.h, while npos_choice is defined in corvid/strings/locating.h
